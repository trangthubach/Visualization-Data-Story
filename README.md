# The Essence of Change
## How artificial intelligence is reshaping Durham Region's job market

This is a group project. When we started designing this project, we knew from the beginning that we wanted to build an immersive experience.  
After brainstorming our options in Miro, we decided to create a scrollytelling story and started working on our data and personas…. At the foundation, this project uses standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. These are organized into full-screen sections to guide the reader through the story one scene at a time.  
For the data-intensive scenes, we chose to use Flourish and integrated its charts smoothly into our layout.  
This decision made the project much easier to maintain.  
Regarding the choice of color theme, blue is frequently used in technology and corporate branding because it conveys professionalism while remaining approachable. The combination of blue and white in the color scheme enhances readability and gives the website a modern interface.  
Towards the end of the experience, the interface transitions to a darker theme, signalling hope and drawing the user’s attention to the key messages ahead.
