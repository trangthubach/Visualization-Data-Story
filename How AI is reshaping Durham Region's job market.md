## Iteration 3: The storyboard
### Article title: The Essence of Change
How artificial intelligence is reshaping Durham Region’s job market in a positive direction
### Scene 1: The story behind
- Background: In the annual Career Fair hosted in Durham Region  
- Text: **_“Four generations, one Job Fair. Outside the Business and IT building at Ontario Tech University, the excitement of a new career collides with a silent threat: a job market already rewritten by AI.”_**
- Context: Lucas (L), Marcus (M), and David (D) discussed why they were attending this career fair. They came to talk with the employers and met Priya (P)
- The lineup: Marcus (M), David (D), Lucas (L), Priya (P) 
- Story:

### Scene 2: Unemployment rate
- Text:
  1. **A Fractured Market** In 2019, the gap between youth and established workers was manageable. Everyone played by the same rules.
  2. **The Great Divergence** Then came the split. While automation and the pandemic barely scratched established careers, **youth unemployment skyrocketed**, exposing the jobs most vulnerable to AI.
- Script: Marcus’s Dilemma  
- Story/Persona 2: In this scene, we introduce Marcus, a recent university graduate struggling to find a job in his field due to the highly competitive job market. He realizes that knowing AI is a valuable asset for job seekers. In response, he decides to enroll in a master's program in AI to enhance his skills.
- We use a heatmap to illustrate the unemployment rate for different age categories from 2006 to 2024. 
- By the persona and graph, we aim to emphasize that the unemployment situation is significant for the youth, particularly new graduates.
- Chart:
