## Iteration 2: Laying out the foundation  
Scrollytelling is excellent for audience engagement through interactive, story-driven experiences. This particular methodology adds more personal perspectives to dry data content.

## Iteration 3: The storyboard
### Article title: The Essence of Change
How artificial intelligence is reshaping Durham Region’s job market in a positive direction
### Scene 1: The story behind
- Background: In the annual Career Fair hosted in Durham Region  
- Text: **_“Four generations, one Job Fair. Outside the Business and IT building at Ontario Tech University, the excitement of a new career collides with a silent threat: a job market already rewritten by AI.”_**
- Context: Lucas (L), Marcus (M), and David (D) discussed why they were attending this career fair. They came to talk with the employers and met Priya (P)
- The lineup: Marcus (M), David (D), Lucas (L), Priya (P) 
- Story:  
  M: Hi, I’m Marcus, I graduated last year and I am now pursuing a Master’s degree.  
  _Subtitle: Marcus Thompson, 23, recent graduate from Durham College_  
  D: Hello, I’m David, nice to meet you. I’m here to find a new job.  
  _Subtitle: David Brown, 46, a tech expert at Bell, and he was recently laid off due to the company's implementation of a new technology and brand, Ateko._  
  L: Hi Marcus, David, I’m Lucas. I’m back to studying for my Master's degree and trying to navigate the job market here in Canada.  
  _Subtitle: Lucas Kai, 33, international student from Italy, background in Computer Science._  
  P: Hello all! I’m Priya and I am attending the fair to connect with potential candidates for our upcoming projects.  
  _Subtitle: Priya Sharma, 24, Senior HR Manager, TD Bank_  

### Scene 2: Unemployment rate
- Script:
  1. **A Fractured Market** In 2019, the gap between youth and established workers was manageable. Everyone played by the same rules.
  2. **The Great Divergence** Then came the split. While automation and the pandemic barely scratched established careers, **_youth unemployment skyrocketed_**, exposing the jobs most vulnerable to AI.
  3. **Left Behind** Today, nearly **_1 in 4 young people_** cannot find work. David’s layoff thrusts him from the safety of the blue line directly into this hostile red reality 
- Story/Persona 2: In this scene, we introduce Marcus, a recent university graduate struggling to find a job in his field due to the highly competitive job market. He realizes that knowing AI is a valuable asset for job seekers. In response, he decides to enroll in a master's program in AI to enhance his skills.
- We use a heatmap to illustrate the unemployment rate for different age categories from 2006 to 2024. 
- By the persona and graph, we aim to emphasize that the unemployment situation is significant for the youth, particularly new graduates.
- Chart:  
  ![Chart 1](https://github.com/TracieTruong/Visualization-Data-Story/blob/16ff9936ed72e6a7dbdeecad156240bef47bceef/Iterations/Iteration%203.1.png)
  *Unemployment rate in Durham Region from 2006 to 2024, divided by age range*

### Scene 3: Top occupations replaced by AI 
- Script:
  1. **As a matter of fact, lots of jobs have been replaced by AI** While David's story is dramatic, it's just one of many. In Durham Region, entire occupations have already been automated away, leaving workers scrambling to retrain.
  2. **Marcus's Dilemma** Marcus graduated from his undergraduate program only to discover his major— computer programming—has been rendered half-obsolete by AI. Now he's forced into a Master's program just to stay competitive.
  3. **The Automation Wave** These aren't new jobs disappearing slowly. They're vanishing fast. The occupations most exposed to AI replacement are those requiring routine, codifiable skills— exactly the entry-level work new graduates depend on. 
- Story/Persona 4: David is portrayed as a laid-off worker due to the application of AI in his old company, Bell. He urges to find another job so he can support his family of 4. 
- A treemap is used to visualize nested categories (from sectors to their top occupations that have been affected by the AI). Moreover, it is space-constrained dashboards; the treemap packs a lot of data into a small area using nested rectangles
- By that, the story can reach the labour force who have been facing an unemployment threat due to the innovation of technology.

  *AI Disruption Across Job Sectors: Leading Roles at Risk*

### Scene 4: The new opportunities: Emerging industry sectors in the Durham region 
- Script:
  1. **But every revolution creates its own stars** With the disruption of AI, a new galaxy of opportunities is born.
  2. For Lucas, a decade of engineering experience wasn't a shield against disruption—it was a vantage point. Seeing the industry shift, he realized that mastering AI was a survival strategy. **He pivoted from traditional manufacturing to the forefront of the robotics revolution**.
- Story/Persona 1: David, an international Master’s student from Italy and his career shift.
- The bubble chart shows net growth of emerging careers (2025-2030). We use a bubble chart to visualize the data because it represents well different data sizes and the relationship between numerical variables, in this case, emerging industries.

  *Net Growth of Emerging Careers (2025–2030)*

### Scene 5: How not to be left behind? 
- Script: Priya said:
  1. The fear is real. I see it in every interview. Candidates ask, _"Will this role exist in five years?"_
  2. "But here's the truth: We aren't looking for people who can beat AI. We're looking for people who can orchestrate it. The top skills we hire for today didn't even exist on job descriptions a decade ago."
- Story/Persona 3: Priya Sharma, a Senior HR from TD Bank. She is attending the Job Fair to seek potential candidates for her company's project. Involving the perspective of a recruiter, we have a better understanding of the whole picture. Companies are sending signals and making efforts to retain and recruit talent. Jobs are being created.
- The final dot chart shows practices that companies within Durham Region are implementing, retention strategies to attract talent by offering competitive compensation and benefits, creating a positive work environment, and investing in employee growth through training and clear career paths.

  *Durham Region's Recruitment & Retention strategies*

### Scene 6: Conclusion
- Script: The future isn't written by AI. It's written by YOU.
  1. **Human Connection** Empathy cannot be automated.
  2. **Embrace Curiosity** AI answers questions. Humans ask them.
  3. **Adaptability is King** The only stability is your ability to learn.
